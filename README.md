### üìù Hazard Scenario Template

Each hazard scenario follows this structure:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Hazard ID** | Unique identifier for each hazard scenario. Often includes abbreviations for the hazard type (e.g., `ME` for Mechanical, `EL` for Electrical) followed by a sequential number. |
| **Hazard Type** | General category of the hazard, as defined in ISO‚ÄØ12100 Annex‚ÄØB (e.g., Mechanical Hazards, Electrical Hazards, Thermal Hazards). |
| **Origin** | Specific source or cause of the hazard (e.g., *Rotating Elements*, *Sharp Edges*, *Falling Objects*). |
| **Potential Consequence** | Potential negative outcome or injury (e.g., *Entanglement*, *Electrocution*, *Burns*, *Hearing Loss*). |
| **User Type** | Role of the person interacting with the machinery when the hazard occurs (e.g., *Operator*, *Maintenance Personnel*, *Setup/Programmer*). |
| **Task** | Specific activity being performed (e.g., *Normal Operation*, *Cleaning*, *Maintenance*, *Setup/Programming*). |
| **Environment** | Operational context (e.g., *Industrial*, *Outdoor*). |
| **Severity** | Level of potential injury, corresponding to ISO‚ÄØ13849-1 categories S1 (*slight*) or S2 (*serious/fatal*). |
| **Frequency** | Exposure frequency, corresponding to ISO‚ÄØ13849-1 categories F1 (*seldom-to-less-often*) or F2 (*frequent-to-continuous*). |
| **Possibility** | Likelihood of occurrence, corresponding to ISO‚ÄØ13849-1 categories P1 (*possible*) or P2 (*likely*). |
| **PLr** | Required Performance Level for safety functions, derived from severity, frequency, and possibility. |
| **Description** | Full narrative description of the hazard scenario. |

### üìú Description Field Generation Template

The `Description` field of each hazard scenario is dynamically generated using the following format:

```text
In {env} settings, {user_type} performing {task} tasks may encounter {origin}, 
which can lead to {consequence}. These tasks are classified as {freq_desc}, 
with a possibility described as {poss_desc}. The severity of potential injuries 
is described as {severity_desc}.
